	<h3>Our philosopy...</h3>

			<p>JobLine aims to be the world's universal job applicaiton. The creators
				of JobLine feel there is no need to keep repeating the same information 
				over and over again, as many find themselves doing when looking for a job.
				Instead, they can create one job application, fill out all the information once, 
				and be able to keep all their data together.
			</p> 
			<p>
				JobLine also benefits emlpoyers! It keeps all your applicants in one place
				and allows for easy management and contanct of potential hires. Companies
				have to go through a strict verification process in order to ensure they 
				are telling the truth, and protects companies from people trying to 
				impersonate them. JobLine is great for everyone! 
			</p>

	<h3>Our history...</h3> 
		<div class = "desc">
			<p>Jobline is the brainchild of Samad Farooqui, Raz Reed, and Wendy 
				Hu after Samad got fed up with the job application process when looking 
				for an intership. It is their ITWS 1100 final term project, something 
				they worked really hard on in order to try and get an amazing grade.
			</p>
			<p>They would like to give a special shoutout to the amazing, Professor 
				Plotka, the illustrious Professor Hay, and the world's best ITWS
				TA, Jeremy.
