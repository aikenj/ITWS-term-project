## Navigating the website:
The user starts at the landing page. From here he/she can login by clicking "login" on the nav bar in the header.
The user is then directed to a login page. The user can login as a company or an applicant, or if the user does not already have an account, he/she can create one by clicking "register now!"
The user will be directed to a page similar to the login page but with more fields. From here he/she can create an account as a company or applicant.
Once the user creates an account or logs in, he/she will be directed to his/her new profile.
From here, if the user is an applicant, he/she can:
- Edit his/her profile information
- View his/her resume
- Check the statuses of his/her applications
- View deadlines
If the user is a company, he/she can:
- Edit his/her profile information
- Add a new job opening
- View applicants to a position
On most webpages, the user can:
- Search jobs/positions (if he/she is an applicant)
- Navigate to the home page by clicking on the logo in the top left corner

## Database model:
